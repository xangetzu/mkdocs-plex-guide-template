# Pinning Libraries

After accepting your invitation to my Plex server, you'll need to pin my shared libraries to your sidebar. This is a required step - without it, you might only see Plex's default content instead of my media collection. Here's what you need to know:

1. Look for "{{ vars.username }}'s Plex" in your media sources
2. You'll see the following libraries: {{ vars.plex_libraries }}
3. Pin these libraries to your sidebar

**Recommended**: Unpin Plex's default libraries to keep your Home screen focused on my content. This is especially important since Plex has been increasingly promoting their own content in 2025, making it harder to distinguish between their media and mine.

!!! tip
    If you see any advertisements while watching, you're viewing Plex's content, not mine. My server never shows ads.
