# Disabling Online Media Sources

Plex offers additional services like Live TV, Music, and Web Shows that you may see in your sidebar. If you're only interested in accessing my Movie and TV Show libraries, you can disable or unpin these extra services to keep your interface clean and focused. This can be done through your Plex application settings and helps prevent confusion between my content and Plex's online services.
