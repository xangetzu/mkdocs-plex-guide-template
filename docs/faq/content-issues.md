# I'm having a problem with a Movie or TV Show

If you encounter any problems with content (such as distorted video, incorrect media, double images, or misaligned subtitles), you have two ways to report it:

## Using Overseerr (Preferred Method)

   1. Visit [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }})
   2. Find the problematic Movie or TV Show
   3. Click the yellow exclamation point icon in the top right
   4. Enter the details of the issue

   While this method isn't required, it helps me track and resolve issues more effectively by creating a searchable history of reported problems.

!!! example "Reporting issues within Overseerr"
    <center><video style="width:65%" controls="true" alt="type:video">
        <source src="../../assets/video/overseerr-reporting-issues.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video></center>

## Why use Overseerr for reporting?

- Creates a documented history of the issue
- Helps me track problems I can't fix immediately
- Makes it easier to identify patterns in content issues
- Provides all the necessary details in one place

## Direct Contact

   - You can always contact me directly about any issues
   - This is perfectly fine and works too!
