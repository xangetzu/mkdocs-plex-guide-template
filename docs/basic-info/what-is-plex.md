# What is Plex?

Plex is a media streaming platform that turns a computer into your personal Netflix-like service. When installed on a server, it creates a polished interface for watching Movies and TV Shows from any device, whether you're at home or away. By joining my Plex server, you get access to my media library without needing to set up or maintain your own server.

    ## An Introduction
    Plex gives you one place to find and access all the media that matters to you. From personal media on your own server, to free and on-demand Movies & Shows or live TV, to streaming music, you can enjoy it all in one app, on any device.

    ## And, it’s really simple to start using…
    First, if you are streaming content provided by us or one of our partners (Movies & Shows, live TV, TIDAL music), then you are good to go as soon as you have an account, just install an app on your phone, Smart TV, computer, or simply open up our web app on your browser!

    If you are looking to set up your own personal media server to house your own video or music files, there are a few more (simple!) steps to get up and running.

    How it works for your own personal content:

    1. Install and run the Plex Media Server on a computer (or compatible NAS device or NVIDIA SHIELD) where all your media is stored and managed in movie, TV show, home video, music, and photo libraries.
    2. Add media libraries by type of content and let Plex do the rest—cataloging, adding artwork and info—it’s all automatic.
    3. Install and open the Plex app on virtually any device—smartphone, tablet, smart TV, streaming device, game console, personal computer, or any browser.
    4. Wherever you are, press play, sit back, and enjoy your media as it streams from the Plex Media Server to your device.
