This guide details common tasks you'll need to perform when joining my Plex server for the first time. The content herein should answer 99% of your questions, though you're always welcome to ask me directly. While this guide primarily shows screenshots from a web browser, you can make these changes from any Plex app (mobile, smart TV, or game console). If you have trouble finding a particular setting, I recommend switching to a web browser to make the changes. All settings in this guide will sync across your devices and only need to be configured once, with one important exception: Plex streaming quality must be set separately the first time you log into each new Plex application.

While you don't need to read this guide from start to finish, new Plex users should at least review the essential sections on [Pinning Libraries](pinning-libraries.md) and [Changing Plex streaming quality](changing-stream-quality/index.md).
